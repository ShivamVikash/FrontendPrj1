# FrontendPrj1
My first project as a software developer, in the domain of Frontend Web Development.
I will be first learning about the basics of a website, then will be switching to frontend web development going through the topics of HTML, CSS, JS.
About to start with the HTML. Then will be going to CSS. After finishing off, then to JavaScript.
